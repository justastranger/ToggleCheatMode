# Toggle Cheat Mode

Adds a hotkey that toggles creative mode and dev commands.		 

Removes the mark on the save file that disables achievements once creative mode is disabled again.

***Does not work in multiplayer*** and I will not add support for it.

## Installation

1. Install BepInEx 6.0.0-pre.1
2. Extract `Dinkum.ToggleCheatMode.dll` to `.\Dinkum\BepInEx\plugins`
